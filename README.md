# JavaScriptForms
This is a simple HTML/CSS/Javascript program that is a email signup form. It check every text field to see if the user filled out the information correctly, if not it says what the user has left to fill out. Once completed the user is taken to a screen that shows the exact time the user finished the form. This is accomplished with a date object in javascript.
